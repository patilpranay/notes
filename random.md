### Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
A string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. Two prominent examples are URLs (more common) and URNs (less common).

A **URL** is a URI that specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation of a resource (e.g., `http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page`).

A **URN** is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace. A URN can be used to talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it (e.g., an ISBN number).
